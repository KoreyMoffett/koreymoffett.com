            <h1 class="subtitle">Doom-Emacs</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="has-text-black">I first started coding about 2 years ago off and on as nothing serious, just as a way to tinker about with my computer when I was at home, but as I started to get deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole that is coding I started to look for
                a serious text editor. When I first started I was using a program called Atom to edit my code(you may have heard of it, the text editor made by github).
                <br> I looked online and saw many people used Atom and that Github was the creater of it so it seemed like a no-brainer. Since then however I have tried nearly every editor under the sun, I tried Atom, Sublime Text, VSCode(Still use some),
                and Vim and I must say most of them were a complete let down.
                <br> For example, When I used Sublime i was always so annoyed by it's keybinding and it's just rather dull design. With Atom, it was great for awhile until it started really slowing down do to the number of add-ons I had and needed for
                the projects I was working on. For Vim and VSCode, These two actually haven't let me down they have been amazing since the day I started using them, but I think it's time to give Emacs a fair chance.
                <br> I always hated on Emacs, saying 'This program has the most idiotic key binds/key-chords', then i found Doom-Emacs(Thanks DistroTube). I have only been using Doom-Emacs for about two hours and I can whole heartly say I love it. Because
                it's Vim, VSCode and Emacs all smashed into one package.
                <br> If you have been looking for a terminal based or GUI text editor that's pretty lightweight but still has all the features you will ever need, I highly recommend Doom-Emacs.

            <h1 class="subtitle">Never again</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="has-text-black">I don't have some horror story of my keyboard breaking or my screen just dying on me, in fact my macbook has held up pretty good. But I have since learned about Linux and after installing Linux on my desktop I see absolutly no reason for Apple
                to even make computers at all to be honestly(Other than to make money but that's obvious.).
                <br> Macs try to fill this really weird area of computing that I just don't see a purpose for. For anything you need to do you can use Linux or Windows and they will do the job better in many cases (other than make apps for iphone and
                mac)
                <br>
                <br> Macs are just super expensive computers with lowend specs, and about 80% of the price you paid for that mac is so you can have that Apple logo on the back.
                <br> I'm not someone who buys a new laptop every year in fact I wait until the laptop has more than one issue to buy a new one in most cases, but I can say with 100% certainty that I will never buy another apple computer rather it be a
                laptop or a desktop mac ever again.
                <br>
                <br> Linux is my prefered OS to compute on.

<title>Why use FOSS?</title>
<guid>https://koreymoffett.com/blog/foss</guid>

<![CDATA[
            <h1 class="subtitle">Why should you care?</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="has-text-black">I guess first I should start of by explaining what FOSS is, FOSS is Free and Open Source Software.
                <br> For a program or software to be consitered free(as in freedom, has nothing to do with price.) it first has to meet the four essential freedoms.
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.<li>
                        <li>Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.</li>
                        <li>Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.</li>
                        <li>Freedoom 3: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified verison to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a necessity.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, to answer the question, "Why should you care about FOSS?"<br>
                You should truly care about FOSS because unlike most software/programs, FOSS won't collect data about you to sell to the highest bidder, but it also gives you the freedom to change the things you don't like about the program or to change the things you need to change to be able to use the program. For example lets say there is a program that someone needs to use but they can't read the font size due to a vision impairment, Well with FOSS they could easily change the font size because they have access to the source code. Not only that but you can also have the peace of mind that the program isn't sending your information to people or companies who have no real reason to see your information.
                <br>
                <br>
                Supporting FOSS is supporting Freedom!
                <br>

<title>Distro hopping is pointless</title>

<![CDATA[
            <h1 class="subtitle">We all do it but it's dumb</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="has-text-black">
                In the Linux world there is a term you will hear thrown around a lot and that "Distro hop" or "Distro hopping", as the name suggests this is when someone installs distribution after distibution expecting to find that perfect one.
                <br>
                Distro hopping just out of curiosity isn't bad in my personaly opinion, but I think constantly wiping your hard drive(ssd in most cases these days) is pointless.
                <br>
                Finding that magic linux distro isn't going to happen, none of them are perfect and anything you don't like about the distro you are currently running(or thinking about running) is easily changable.
                The only real reason I can see for distro hopping is say for example you are running ubuntu and you want something more minimal you could install something like Debian or Arch other than that there isn't much purpose in it.
                <br>
                <br>
                I myself have been that new to linux user who want to try the newest shiny thing he sees but it really is a massive waste of time, energy and can be damaging to your workflow as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                I recently made the switch to base debian as I wanted a more minimal system and so far I have had zero issues. Debian is rock solid and thats why I love it.
                Sure it may not have the lastest packages, but you when you install a package you can know for a fact it will work, unlike with arch.

            <h1 class="subtitle">and other freedom hating platforms.</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="has-text-black">
                As you my know recently platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat and many others have been recently banning and removing anyone they disagree with rather it's a political belief or
                your favorite breakfast cereal Big Tech has shown that it can defy the laws and do what it wants.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you are looking for some alternatives to those freedom hating platforms here are a few.
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a></li> - Twitter like but completly federated. I personaly am on the fosstodon instance.
                    <li><a href="lbry.tv">LBRY</a>/<a href="odysee.com">Odysee</a></li> - This can replace Youtube and even has a neat crypto system to tip the creators, both of these are the same things they just have diffrent UI
                    <li><a href="signal.org">Signal</a></li> - This isn't a free and open source application but if you are still using whatsapp or any other facebook trash this is a good replacemant and lets you encrypt your messages.

<title>What is Mastodon</title>

            <h1 class="subtitle">the elephant is better than the bird.</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="has-text-black">
                If you read <a href="stop-using-twitter">Stop Using Twitter!</a> you my recall that I mentioned something called Mastodon
                Mastodon is a social site that allows users to set up instances and microblog comparable to Twitter.
                However the benifits to Mastodon far outweigh anything twitter has to offer.
                <br>
                Mastodon is a federated social site meaning there is no central rule book or agenda being followed.
                <br>
                The users will join an instance that best suits there intrests or there intrest leading to communities being built around a common intrest.
                You may think it's a bad thing that there are no central rules to the site but let me explain, each instance has it's own rules.
                <br>
                For example some instances may not allow users to use foul language and some may fully allow it.
                <br>
                <br>
                The beauty of a site like Mastodon is that even if your instance kicks you, you can still go join another instance with the same account.
                <br>
                If you were on mstdon.social and they decided they don't like what you are posting or maybe you broke the rules and kick you, you could go join fosstodon.org (which is the instance im in).
                As you can see just from the very few point I actully talked about mastodon does still have a way of regulating itself and dealing with the trolls.
                <br>
                <br>
                <hr>
                If you are intrested in joining up on mastodon and have a love for FOSS(Free and Open Source Software)
                I would highly recommend joining <a href="https://fosstodon.org">Fosstodon</a> I have been here for a few months now and I have had a very good time.
                <br>
                It's actually like a little community of some pretty cool people.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you aren't into FOSS but still want to join mastodon i recommend going to <a href="https://instances.social">Matodon Instances</a> here you will find tons of other instances that may suit you better.
                    <br>
                    I hope to see many new toots on mastodon :)  (post on mastodon are called toots i'm not weird or something lol)

            <h1 class="subtitle">This first step into the world of GNU/Linux</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="has-text-black">
                Before i begin i guess i should say this post is mostly for new to linux users, however you are more than welcome to keep reading if you are a pro as well :)
                <br>
                If you are new to linux or maybe you are looking to jump into linux i would highly recommend using Pop! OS, Linux Mint or maybe Manjaro and ill tell you why.
                <br>
                <br>
                <a href="https://pop.system76.com"/>Pop! OS</a> is actually the first distro i ever installed and i never had any issues with it, It also has some pretty good defaults
                as well as works pretty well "out of the box" for you gamers.
                <br>
                Although i'm no longer a fan of GNOME the desktop enviornment is very well polished and perfect for the new user to really get a little more comfortable with a linux system.
                <br>
                <br>
                <a href="https://linuxmint.com"/>Linux Mint</a> is another very popular and well regarded distro for many reasons.
                <br>
                It has a very familiar feel to Windows so it's perfect for those of you moving from Windows as well as has a very help full community, so if you have any issues feel free to ask the
                linux mint community.
                <br>
                <br>
                <a href="https://manjaro.org"/>Manjaro</a> is a good distro if you are wanting to jump into the arch side of things without the hassle of installing main line arch, and thats honestly the thing manjaro is most known for,
                it's user friendly nature while still letting you harness the power of arch. However i must say manjaro is a much less forgiving system if you make changes your shouldn't have more install a bad package.
                <br>
                <br>
                At the end of the day though it's important to remember that distro doesn't matter, once you get familiar with the differences between debian and arch (the two main distros)
                linux is linux is linux.
                <br>
                I hope to see you noobies in the linux communities asking questions :).
                <br>
                <br>
                oh, i use debian btw

            <h1 class="subtitle">My favorites so far</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="has-text-black">
                As you can tell my the title of this post I wanted to make a quick little post sharing the software/programs
                I use on a daily basis.
                <br>
                <br>
                My distro of choice is GNU/Linux Debian (Buster).
                <br>
                I really like debian for many reasons but the main reason is its stability, you don't have to worry about updating and your system braking as debian has many layers of production to ensure that won't happen.
                <br>
                Also I really like the logo lol(not a main reason but thought I would throw that in).
                <br>
                <br>
                The window manager I've been using for some time now is Spectrwm, I really like the simplicity.
                <br>
                It's config file is beyond easy to customize and the baked in statusbar is more than enough for my needs.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now on to text editors... here is where everyone pulls out their swords and prepares to battle.
                <br>
                My text editor of choice is both Vim and Emacs, let me explain lol. For bigger projects such as this website or any other projects I will be spending time input
                I use Emacs but not base emacs I actually use a distro of Emacs called Doom-Emacs. And as far as Vim I mostly use it for those quick edits to a file say maybe my .zshrc.
                <br>
                <br>
                My terminal as of now is Kitty but honestly I like Alacritty just as much, I can pretty much any terminal emulator.
                <br>
                <br>
                My web browser of choice is Brave at the moment but I'm not quite sure if i'll be sticking with it yet.
                <br>
                <br>
                And this one I just kinda threw into the list last minute but for a graphical file manager i use pcmanfm, because it is dead simple.

<h1 class="subtitle">Mastodon Client</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="has-text-black">
                I have been using <a href="https://tusky.app/">Tusky</a> now for around 3 months and I have nothing but the best to say about it.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have tried other mastodon clients before and all of them work yes, but none of them have the same level of polish as Tusky.
                <br>
                I started using Tusky right after I completly got rid of my Twitter account and even the twitter app doesn't come close to the the same clean and polished design of Tusky.
                <br>
                The best part about Tusky is that it is completly free and open source software. I think it's only avaliable on Android devices through.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you are intrested in giving it a try I recommend downloading with F-droid instead of Google Play.(Google is the devil Fdroid is the bringer of all things good...oh and it's FOSS so its a no brainer for me).

<h1 class="subtitle">The return of Me Myself and I</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="has-text-black">
                Hello everyone, if you read my last blog post I said that I would be moving and I wasn't sure about the internet situation at the new house, well it turns out that
                we actually can't get an actual ISP so we have to use mobile hotspots for all things internet.
                <br>
                As bad as that might sound it's actually been pretty simple and the connection has been pretty stable.
                <br>
                <br>
                Also, I started learning C++, I was learning C but from what I can see C++ is just C with more features and by learning C++ i'm pretty much learning C.
                <br>
                <br>
                That's it.. thats my little update
            </p>
