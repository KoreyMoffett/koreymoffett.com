            <h1 class="subtitle">I don't like what you said so *poof* you are gone</h1>

                On the off chance that you haven't heard the term Cancle Culture before I wil give you the definition.
                <br>
                <br> Cancle Culture refers to the popular practice of with drawing support for (canceling) public figures and companies after they have done or said something objectionable or offensive. Cancle culture is generally discussed as being performed
                on social media in the form of group shaming.
                <br>
                <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/pop-culture/cancel-culture/">Source</a>

                <br>
                <br> Many people seem to not have any issue with this, but I have a huge issue with this practice.
                <br> Because the people doing this cancleing are inconsistance, they will tell in one moment to be yourself and then in the next moment you are being canclled because they don't like who you are.
                <br> This goes much further than personal traits as well, they can cancle you for anything they deem 'wrong' rather that be your political views, religion, race or anything else.
                <br>
                <br> Do you know why so many people like me think this practice is bad and dangerous, it's because we have looked at history and seen the lynch mobs and the riots and killing of people who were 'witches' the cancling doesn't stop until
                it goes way overboard and results in the loss of lives and destruction of those they deem bad.
                <br> As long as we as people in society (insert we live in a society meme) allow the bully tactics to work they will keep doing it.
                <br> So stand strong and don't bow down to the mob.
                <br> They are in a mob because they are weak on their own.
                <br>
                <br> My advise to anyone who finds themselve in this situation.
                <br> 1.) Don't apologize to the mob, if you say sorry you are admitting that you did something wrong and that you deserve the treatment.
                <br> 2.) Ignore them to the best of your ablility, They will harass you until you break if you let them.
                <br> 3.) Keep in mind you aren't cancled unless you allow yourself to be, Their whole game is a bully tactic, don't allow it to be your end.
