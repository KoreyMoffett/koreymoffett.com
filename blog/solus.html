            <h1 class="subtitle">I distro hopped after telling you not to hehe</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="has-text-black">
              First let me explain why I made the switch in the first place.
              <br>
              About a week ago I made the bright decision(This is sarcasm im just not good at it) to switch over to Debian testing from Debian stable and to make a long story short it didn't go well.
              <br>
              Now at this point a person who had good system admin skills and or half a brain in there head would be like "Good thing I make back ups!", this person is not me lol.
              <br>
              <br>
              So i decided to give solus a try as i've always thought solus was pretty cool from everything i read and had seen on the distribution.
              <br>
              Fast forward a week and these are my thoughts.
              <br>
              Solus is the perfect example of easy to install, a beautiful user interface and mostly sane pre-installed software(i say mostly because it is a bit heavy out of the box)
              <br>
              I am still currently blown away by how beautiful and easy to use the Budgie desktop evironment really is, it has become my favorite desktop enviornment.
              And i dont forsee myself moving away from solus as package avaliblity hasn't been an issue for me.
              <br>
              The worst things about this distro for me were getting my brain to remember eopkg rather than apt or pacman or something and the pre-installed software that i mentioned previously.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h1 class="subtitle">State of the blog/Life Update</h1>
              <br>
              Recently I had my website Brave verified as currently i do not have a job and the search for one doesn't seem to be getting any better
              <br>
              I will never lock anything i make behind a pay wall just letting everyone know why i verified my website as I try to be as trasparent as possible.
              <br>
              If you only view this in an RSS reader than you can disregard this.
