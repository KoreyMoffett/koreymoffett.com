              JavaScript, You either love it or you hate it... well actually that's not true. See I don't believe JavaScript is inherently bad, in fact if used correctly I't allows for some very useful and even just plain cool things to be anchived from the web browser.
              <br>
              Don't get me wrong I still thing JavaScript shouldn't be used nearly as much as it is. For example, If you are just trying to have a sentence display on your website their is absolutly no reason to do that with JavaScript. HTML and CSS should still be the core of all websites, JavaScript is a little spice you throw in to give a little pizzaz or for a cool animation here and there.
              <br>
              When JavaScript is used to the point that the entire site is just a giant script or a million little scripts is where I see a huge issue with it, It's just slow and pointless at that point really.
              <br>
              <br>
              This is a super short blog but I just really wanted to get my thoughts out on it and also announce that I'm going to be learning JavaScript(I know sue me right lol) as I would like to get more into web development.
              <br>
              <br>
              I'm actually pretty curious of what you guys think.
              <br>
              Is JavaScript the Devil or not so bad?
              <br>
              Let me know in the comments :)
